/*

println prints strings on console.
In Rust, variables are immutable by default, meaning once we give the variable a value, the value won’t change.
To make a variable mutable, we add mut before the variable name

The other difference between mut and shadowing is that because we’re effectively creating a new variable 
when we use the let keyword again, we can change the type of the value but reuse the same name.
